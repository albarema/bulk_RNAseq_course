Normalization method	Description	Accounted factors	Recommendations for use
**CPM** (counts per million)	counts scaled by total number of reads	sequencing depth	gene count comparisons between replicates of the same samplegroup; **NOT for within sample comparisons or DE analysis**
**TPM** (transcripts per kilobase million)	counts per length of transcript (kb) per million reads mapped	sequencing depth and gene length	gene count comparisons within a sample or between samples of the same sample group; **NOT for DE analysis**
**RPKM/FPKM** (reads/fragments per kilobase of exon per million reads/fragments mapped)	similar to TPM	sequencing depth and gene length	gene count comparisons between genes within a sample; **NOT for between sample comparisons or DE analysis**
[DESeq2’s **median of ratios**](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2010-11-10-r106)	counts divided by sample-specific size factors determined by median ratio of gene counts relative to geometric mean per gene	sequencing depth and RNA composition	gene count comparisons between samples and for **DE analysis**; **NOT for within sample comparisons**
[EdgeR’s **trimmed mean of M values (TMM)**](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2010-11-3-r25)	uses a weighted trimmed mean of the log expression ratios between samples	sequencing depth, RNA composition	gene count comparisons between samples and for **DE analysis**; **NOT for within sample comparisons**
