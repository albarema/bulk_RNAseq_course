## Differential expression analysis with DESeq2

The final step in the differential expression analysis workflow is
**fitting the raw counts to the NB model and performing the statistical
test** for differentially expressed genes. In this step we essentially
want to determine whether the mean expression levels of different sample
groups are significantly different.

The [DESeq2
paper](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8)
was published in 2014, but the package is continually updated and
available for use in R through Bioconductor. It builds on good ideas for
dispersion estimation and use of Generalized Linear Models from the
[DSS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4005660/) and
[edgeR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2796818/) methods.

Differential expression analysis with DESeq2 involves multiple steps as
displayed in the flowchart below in blue. Briefly, DESeq2 will model the
raw counts, using normalization factors (size factors) to account for
differences in library depth. Then, it will estimate the gene-wise
dispersions and shrink these estimates to generate more accurate
estimates of dispersion to model the counts. Finally, DESeq2 will fit
the negative binomial model and perform hypothesis testing using the
Wald test or Likelihood Ratio Test.

Prior to performing the differential expression analysis, it is a good
idea to know what **sources of variation** are present in your data,
either by exploration during the QC and/or prior knowledge. Once you
know the major sources of variation, you can remove them prior to
analysis or control for them in the statistical model by including them
in your **design formula**.

### Design formula

A design formula tells the statistical software the known sources of
variation to control for, as well as, the factor of interest to test for
during differential expression testing. For example, if you know that
sex is a significant source of variation in your data, then `sex` should
be included in your model. **The design formula should have all of the
factors in your metadata that account for major sources of variation in
your data. The last factor entered in the formula should be the
condition of interest.**

For example, suppose you have the following metadata:

<img src="./img/07_extra_contrast_design/metadata.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

If you want to examine the expression differences between `condition`,
and you know that major sources of variation include `bloodtype` and
`patient`, then your design formula would be:

`design = ~ bloodtype + patient + condition`

The tilde (`~`) should always precede your factors and tells DESeq2 to
model the counts using the following formula. Note the **factors
included in the design formula need to match the column names in the
metadata**.

In this tutorial we show a general and flexible way to define contrasts,
and is often useful for more complex contrasts or when the design of the
experiment is imbalanced (e.g. different number of replicates in each
group). Although we focus on **DESeq2**, the approach can also be used
with the other popular package **edgeR**.

Each section below covers a particular experimental design, from simpler
to more complex ones. The first chunk of code in each section is to
simulate data, which has no particular meaning and is only done in order
to have a DESeqDataSet object with the right kind of variables for each
example. In practice, users can ignore this step as they should have
created a DESeqDataSet object from their own data following the
[instructions in the
vignette](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#the-deseqdataset).

## One factor, two levels

``` r
# simulate data
dds <- makeExampleDESeqDataSet(n = 1000, m = 6, betaSD = 2)
dds$condition <- factor(rep(c("control", "treat"), each = 3))
```

First we can look at our sample information:

``` r
colData(dds)
```

    ## DataFrame with 6 rows and 1 column
    ##         condition
    ##          <factor>
    ## sample1   control
    ## sample2   control
    ## sample3   control
    ## sample4   treat  
    ## sample5   treat  
    ## sample6   treat

Our factor of interest is `condition` and so we define our design and
run the DESeq model fitting routine:

``` r
design(dds) <- ~ 1 + condition # or just `~ condition`
dds <- DESeq(dds) # equivalent to edgeR::glmFit()
```

Then check what coefficients DESeq estimated:

``` r
resultsNames(dds)
```

    ## [1] "Intercept"                  "condition_treat_vs_control"

We can see that we have a coefficient for our `intercept` and
coefficient for the effect of `treat` (i.e. differences between treat
versus control).

Using the more standard syntax, we can obtain the results for the effect
of treat as such:

``` r
res1 <- results(dds, contrast = list("condition_treat_vs_control"))
res1
```

The above is a simple way to obtain the results of interest. But it is
worth understanding how DESeq is getting to these results by looking at
the model’s matrix. DESeq defines the model matrix using base R
functionality:

``` r
model.matrix(design(dds), colData(dds))
```

    ##         (Intercept) conditiontreat
    ## sample1           1              0
    ## sample2           1              0
    ## sample3           1              0
    ## sample4           1              1
    ## sample5           1              1
    ## sample6           1              1
    ## attr(,"assign")
    ## [1] 0 1
    ## attr(,"contrasts")
    ## attr(,"contrasts")$condition
    ## [1] "contr.treatment"

We can see that R coded `condition` as a dummy variable, with an
intercept (common to all samples) and a “conditiontreat” variable, which
adds the effect of treat to samples 4-6.

We can actually set our contrasts in `DESeq2::results()` using a numeric
vector. The way it works is to define a vector of “weights” for the
coefficient(s) we want to test for. In this case, we have `(Intercept)`
and `conditiontreat` as our coefficients (see model matrix above), and
we want to test for the effect of treat, so our contrast vector would be
`c(0, 1)`. In other words, we don’t care about the value of
`(Intercept)` (so it has a weight of 0), and we’re only interested in
the effect of treat (so we give it a weight of 1).

In this case the design is very simple, so we could define our contrast
vector “manually”. But for complex designs this can get more difficult
to do, so it’s worth mentioning the general way in which we can define
this. For any contrast of interest, we can follow three steps:

-   Get the model matrix
-   Subset the matrix for each group of interest and calculate its
    column means - this results in a vector of coefficients for each
    group
-   Subtract the group vectors from each other according to the
    comparison we’re interested in

Let’s see this example in action:

``` r
# get the model matrix
mod_mat <- model.matrix(design(dds), colData(dds))
mod_mat
```

    ##         (Intercept) conditiontreat
    ## sample1           1              0
    ## sample2           1              0
    ## sample3           1              0
    ## sample4           1              1
    ## sample5           1              1
    ## sample6           1              1
    ## attr(,"assign")
    ## [1] 0 1
    ## attr(,"contrasts")
    ## attr(,"contrasts")$condition
    ## [1] "contr.treatment"

``` r
# calculate the vector of coefficient weights in the treat
treat <- colMeans(mod_mat[dds$condition == "treat", ])
treat
```

    ##    (Intercept) conditiontreat 
    ##              1              1

``` r
# calculate the vector of coefficient weights in the control
control <- colMeans(mod_mat[dds$condition == "control", ])
control
```

    ##    (Intercept) conditiontreat 
    ##              1              0

``` r
# The contrast we are interested in is the difference between treat and control
treat - control
```

    ##    (Intercept) conditiontreat 
    ##              0              1

That last step is where we define our contrast vector, and we can give
this directly to the `results` function:

``` r
# get the results for this contrast
res2 <- results(dds, contrast = treat - control)
```

This gives us exactly the same results as before, which we can check for
example by plotting the log-fold-changes between the first and second
approach:

``` r
plot(res1$log2FoldChange, res2$log2FoldChange)
```

<img src="./img/07_extra_contrast_design/contrast_res1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

## Recoding the design

Often, we can use different model matrices that essentially correspond
to the same design. For example, we could recode our design above by
removing the intercept:

``` r
design(dds) <- ~ 0 + condition
dds <- DESeq(dds)
resultsNames(dds)
```

    ## [1] "conditioncontrol" "conditiontreat"

In this case we get a coefficient corresponding to the average
expression in control and the average expression in the treat (rather
than the *difference* between treat and control).

If we use the same contrast trick as before (using the model matrix), we
can see the result is the same:

``` r
# get the model matrix
mod_mat <- model.matrix(design(dds), colData(dds))
mod_mat
```

    ##         conditioncontrol conditiontreat
    ## sample1                1              0
    ## sample2                1              0
    ## sample3                1              0
    ## sample4                0              1
    ## sample5                0              1
    ## sample6                0              1
    ## attr(,"assign")
    ## [1] 1 1
    ## attr(,"contrasts")
    ## attr(,"contrasts")$condition
    ## [1] "contr.treatment"

``` r
# calculate weights for coefficients in each condition
treat <- colMeans(mod_mat[which(dds$condition == "treat"), ])
control <- colMeans(mod_mat[which(dds$condition == "control"), ])
# get the results for our contrast
res3 <- results(dds, contrast = treat - control)
```

Again, the results are essentially the same:

``` r
plot(res1$log2FoldChange, res3$log2FoldChange)
```

<img src="./img/07_extra_contrast_design/contrast_res2.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

In theory there’s no difference between these two ways of defining our
design. The design with an intercept is more common, but for the
purposes of understanding what’s going on, it’s sometimes easier to look
at models without intercept.

## One factor, three levels

``` r
# simulate data
dds <- makeExampleDESeqDataSet(n = 1000, m = 9, betaSD = 2)
dds$condition <- NULL
dds$bloodtype <- factor(rep(c("bloodA", "bloodB", "bloodO"), each = 3))
dds$bloodtype <- relevel(dds$bloodtype, "bloodO")
```

First we can look at our sample information:

``` r
colData(dds)
```

    ## DataFrame with 9 rows and 1 column
    ##         bloodtype
    ##          <factor>
    ## sample1    bloodA
    ## sample2    bloodA
    ## sample3    bloodA
    ## sample4    bloodB
    ## sample5    bloodB
    ## sample6    bloodB
    ## sample7    bloodO
    ## sample8    bloodO
    ## sample9    bloodO

As in the previous example, we only have one factor of interest,
`bloodtype`, and so we define our design and run the DESeq as before:

``` r
design(dds) <- ~ 1 + bloodtype
dds <- DESeq(dds)
# check the coefficients estimated by DEseq
resultsNames(dds)
```

    ## [1] "Intercept"                  "bloodtype_bloodA_vs_bloodO"
    ## [3] "bloodtype_bloodB_vs_bloodO"

We see that now we have 3 coefficients:

-   “Intercept” corresponds to bloodO bloodtype (our reference level)
-   “bloodtype_bloodA_vs_bloodO” corresponds to the difference between
    the reference level and bloodA
-   “bloodtype_bloodB_vs_bloodO” corresponds to the difference between
    the reference level and bloodB

We could obtain the difference between bloodO and any of the two
bloodtypes easily:

``` r
res1_bloodA_bloodO <- results(dds, contrast = list("bloodtype_bloodA_vs_bloodO"))
res1_bloodB_bloodO <- results(dds, contrast = list("bloodtype_bloodB_vs_bloodO"))
```

For comparing bloodA vs bloodB, however, we need to compare two
coefficients with each other to check whether they are themselves
different (check the slide to see the illustration). This is how the
standard DESeq syntax would be:

``` r
res1_bloodA_bloodB <- results(dds, contrast = list("bloodtype_bloodA_vs_bloodO", 
                                                 "bloodtype_bloodB_vs_bloodO"))
```

However, following our three steps detailed in the first section, we can
define our comparisons from the design matrix:

``` r
# define the model matrix
mod_mat <- model.matrix(design(dds), colData(dds))
mod_mat
```

    ##         (Intercept) bloodtypebloodA bloodtypebloodB
    ## sample1           1               1               0
    ## sample2           1               1               0
    ## sample3           1               1               0
    ## sample4           1               0               1
    ## sample5           1               0               1
    ## sample6           1               0               1
    ## sample7           1               0               0
    ## sample8           1               0               0
    ## sample9           1               0               0
    ## attr(,"assign")
    ## [1] 0 1 1
    ## attr(,"contrasts")
    ## attr(,"contrasts")$bloodtype
    ## [1] "contr.treatment"

``` r
# calculate coefficient vectors for each group
bloodA <- colMeans(mod_mat[dds$bloodtype == "bloodA", ])
bloodB <- colMeans(mod_mat[dds$bloodtype == "bloodB", ])
bloodO <- colMeans(mod_mat[dds$bloodtype == "bloodO", ])
```

And we can now define any contrasts we want:

``` r
# obtain results for each pairwise contrast
res2_bloodA_bloodO <- results(dds, contrast = bloodA - bloodO)
res2_bloodB_bloodO <- results(dds, contrast = bloodB - bloodO)
res2_bloodA_bloodB <- results(dds, contrast = bloodA - bloodB)
# plot the results from the two approaches to check that they are identical
plot(res1_bloodA_bloodO$log2FoldChange, res2_bloodA_bloodO$log2FoldChange)
plot(res1_bloodB_bloodO$log2FoldChange, res2_bloodB_bloodO$log2FoldChange)
plot(res1_bloodA_bloodB$log2FoldChange, res2_bloodA_bloodB$log2FoldChange)
```

## A and B against O

With this approach, we could even define a more unusual contrast, for
example to find genes that differ between A and B against and O samples:

``` r
# define vector of coefficients for A_B samples
A_B <- colMeans(mod_mat[dds$bloodtype %in% c("bloodA", "bloodB"),])
# Our contrast of interest is
A_B - bloodO
```

    ##     (Intercept) bloodtypebloodA bloodtypebloodB 
    ##             0.0             0.5             0.5

Notice the contrast vector in this case assigns a “weight” of 0.5 to
each of `bloodtypebloodA` and `bloodtypebloodB`. This is equivalent to
saying that we want to consider the average of bloodA and bloodB
expression. In fact, we could have also defined our contrast vector like
this:

``` r
# average of bloodA and bloodB minus bloodO
(bloodA + bloodB)/2 - bloodO
```

    ##     (Intercept) bloodtypebloodA bloodtypebloodB 
    ##             0.0             0.5             0.5

To obtain our results, we use the `results()` function as before:

``` r
# get the results between A_B and bloodA
res2_AB <- results(dds, contrast = A_B - bloodO)
```

## Extra: why not define a new group in our design matrix?

For this last example (A_B vs bloodO), we may have considered creating a
new variable in our column data:

``` r
dds$A_B <- factor(dds$bloodtype %in% c("bloodA", "bloodB"))
colData(dds)
```

    ## DataFrame with 9 rows and 3 columns
    ##         bloodtype sizeFactor      A_B
    ##          <factor>  <numeric> <factor>
    ## sample1    bloodA   0.972928    TRUE 
    ## sample2    bloodA   0.985088    TRUE 
    ## sample3    bloodA   0.960749    TRUE 
    ## sample4    bloodB   0.916582    TRUE 
    ## sample5    bloodB   0.936918    TRUE 
    ## sample6    bloodB   1.137368    TRUE 
    ## sample7    bloodO   1.071972    FALSE
    ## sample8    bloodO   1.141490    FALSE
    ## sample9    bloodO   1.140135    FALSE

and then re-run DESeq with a new design:

``` r
design(dds) <- ~ 1 + A_B
dds <- DESeq(dds)
resultsNames(dds)
```

    ## [1] "Intercept"         "A_B_TRUE_vs_FALSE"

``` r
res1_A_B <- results(dds, contrast = list("A_B_TRUE_vs_FALSE"))
```

However, in this model the gene dispersion is estimated together for
bloodA and bloodB samples as if they were replicates of each other,
which may result in inflated/deflated estimates. Instead, our approach
above estimates the error within each of those groups.

To check the difference one could compare the two approaches visually:

``` r
# compare the log-fold-changes between the two approaches
plot(res1_A_B$log2FoldChange, res2_AB$log2FoldChange)
abline(0, 1, col = "brown", lwd = 2)
```

<img src="./img/07_extra_contrast_design/contrast_res3.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

``` r
# compare the errors between the two approaches
plot(res1_A_B$lfcSE, res2_AB$lfcSE)
abline(0, 1, col = "brown", lwd = 2)
```

<img src="./img/07_extra_contrast_design/contrast_res4.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

## Two factors with interaction

``` r
# simulate data
dds <- makeExampleDESeqDataSet(n = 1000, m = 12, betaSD = 2)
dds$bloodtype <- factor(rep(c("bloodO", "bloodA"), each = 6))
dds$bloodtype <- relevel(dds$bloodtype, "bloodO")
dds$condition <- factor(rep(c("treat", "control"), 6))
dds <- dds[, order(dds$bloodtype, dds$condition)]
colnames(dds) <- paste0("sample", 1:ncol(dds))
```

First let’s look at our sample information:

``` r
colData(dds)
```

    ## DataFrame with 12 rows and 2 columns
    ##          condition bloodtype
    ##           <factor>  <factor>
    ## sample1    control    bloodO
    ## sample2    control    bloodO
    ## sample3    control    bloodO
    ## sample4    treat      bloodO
    ## sample5    treat      bloodO
    ## ...            ...       ...
    ## sample8    control    bloodA
    ## sample9    control    bloodA
    ## sample10   treat      bloodA
    ## sample11   treat      bloodA
    ## sample12   treat      bloodA

This time we have two factors of interest, and we want to model both
with an interaction (i.e. we assume that bloodA and bloodO samples may
respond differently to treat/control). We define our design accordingly
and fit the model:

``` r
design(dds) <- ~ 1 + bloodtype + condition + bloodtype:condition
dds <- DESeq(dds)
resultsNames(dds)
```

    ## [1] "Intercept"                      "bloodtype_bloodA_vs_bloodO"    
    ## [3] "condition_treat_vs_control"     "bloodtypebloodA.conditiontreat"

Because we have two factors and an interaction, the number of
comparisons we can do is larger. Using our three-step approach from the
model matrix, we do things exactly as we’ve been doing so far:

``` r
# get the model matrix
mod_mat <- model.matrix(design(dds), colData(dds))
# Define coefficient vectors for each condition
bloodO_control <- colMeans(mod_mat[dds$bloodtype == "bloodO" & dds$condition == "control", ])
bloodO_treat <- colMeans(mod_mat[dds$bloodtype == "bloodO" & dds$condition == "treat", ])
bloodA_control <- colMeans(mod_mat[dds$bloodtype == "bloodA" & dds$condition == "control", ])
bloodA_treat <- colMeans(mod_mat[dds$bloodtype == "bloodA" & dds$condition == "treat", ])
```

We are now ready to define any contrast of interest from these vectors
(for completeness we show the equivalent syntax using the coefficient’s
names from DESeq).

bloodA vs bloodO (in the control):

``` r
res1 <- results(dds, contrast = bloodA_control - bloodO_control)
# or equivalently
res2 <- results(dds, contrast = list("bloodtype_bloodA_vs_bloodO"))
```

bloodA vs bloodO (in the treatment):

``` r
res1 <- results(dds, contrast = bloodO_treat - bloodA_treat)
# or equivalently
res2 <- results(dds, contrast = list(c("bloodtype_bloodA_vs_bloodO",
                                       "bloodtypebloodA.conditiontreat")))
```

treat vs control (for bloodtypes O):

``` r
res1 <- results(dds, contrast = bloodO_treat - bloodO_control)
# or equivalently
res2 <- results(dds, contrast = list(c("condition_treat_vs_control")))
```

treat vs control (for bloodtypes A):

``` r
res1 <- results(dds, contrast = bloodA_treat - bloodA_control)
# or equivalently
res2 <- results(dds, contrast = list(c("condition_treat_vs_control", 
                                       "bloodtypebloodA.conditiontreat")))
```

Interaction between bloodtype and condition

I.e. do bloodAs and bloodOs respond differently to the treatment?

``` r
res1 <- results(dds, 
                contrast = (bloodA_treat - bloodA_control) - (bloodO_treat - bloodO_control))
# or equivalently
res2 <- results(dds, contrast = list("bloodtypebloodA.conditiontreat"))
```

In conclusion, although we can define these contrasts using DESeq
coefficient names, it is somewhat more explicit (and perhaps intuitive?)
what it is we’re comparing using matrix-based contrasts.

## Three factors, with nesting

``` r
# simulate data
dds <- makeExampleDESeqDataSet(n = 1000, m = 24, betaSD = 2)
dds$bloodtype <- factor(rep(c("bloodA", "bloodO"), each = 12))
dds$bloodtype <- relevel(dds$bloodtype, "bloodO")
dds$patient <- factor(rep(LETTERS[1:4], each = 6))
dds$condition <- factor(rep(c("treat", "control"), 12))
dds <- dds[, order(dds$bloodtype, dds$patient, dds$condition)]
colnames(dds) <- paste0("sample", 1:ncol(dds))
```

First let’s look at our sample information:

``` r
colData(dds)
```

    ## DataFrame with 24 rows and 3 columns
    ##          condition bloodtype  patient
    ##           <factor>  <factor> <factor>
    ## sample1    control    bloodO        C
    ## sample2    control    bloodO        C
    ## sample3    control    bloodO        C
    ## sample4    treat      bloodO        C
    ## sample5    treat      bloodO        C
    ## ...            ...       ...      ...
    ## sample20   control    bloodA        B
    ## sample21   control    bloodA        B
    ## sample22   treat      bloodA        B
    ## sample23   treat      bloodA        B
    ## sample24   treat      bloodA        B

Now we have three factors, but patient is *nested* within bloodtype
(i.e. a patient is either bloodA or bloodO, it cannot be both).
Therefore, bloodtype is a linear combination with patient (or, another
way to think about it is that bloodtype is redundant with patient).
Because of this, we will define our design without including
“bloodtype”, although later we can compare groups of patient of the same
bloodtype with each other.

``` r
design(dds) <- ~ 1 + patient + condition + patient:condition
dds <- DESeq(dds)
resultsNames(dds)
```

    ## [1] "Intercept"                  "patient_B_vs_A"            
    ## [3] "patient_C_vs_A"             "patient_D_vs_A"            
    ## [5] "condition_treat_vs_control" "patientB.conditiontreat"   
    ## [7] "patientC.conditiontreat"    "patientD.conditiontreat"

Now it’s harder to define contrasts between groups of patient of the
same bloodtype using DESeq’s coefficient names (although still
possible). But using the model matrix approach, we do it in exactly the
same way we have done so far!

Again, let’s define our groups from the model matrix:

``` r
# get the model matrix
mod_mat <- model.matrix(design(dds), colData(dds))
# define coefficient vectors for each group
bloodO_control <- colMeans(mod_mat[dds$bloodtype == "bloodO" & dds$condition == "control", ])
bloodA_control <- colMeans(mod_mat[dds$bloodtype == "bloodA" & dds$condition == "control", ])
bloodO_treat <- colMeans(mod_mat[dds$bloodtype == "bloodO" & dds$condition == "treat", ])
bloodA_treat <- colMeans(mod_mat[dds$bloodtype == "bloodA" & dds$condition == "treat", ])
```

It’s worth looking at some of these vectors, to see that they are
composed of weighted coefficients from different patient. For example,
for “bloodO” patient, we have equal contribution from “patientC” and
“patientD”:

``` r
bloodO_control
```

    ##             (Intercept)                patientB                patientC 
    ##                     1.0                     0.0                     0.5 
    ##                patientD          conditiontreat patientB:conditiontreat 
    ##                     0.5                     0.0                     0.0 
    ## patientC:conditiontreat patientD:conditiontreat 
    ##                     0.0                     0.0

And so, when we define our contrasts, each patient will be correctly
weighted:

``` r
bloodO_treat - bloodO_control
```

    ##             (Intercept)                patientB                patientC 
    ##                     0.0                     0.0                     0.0 
    ##                patientD          conditiontreat patientB:conditiontreat 
    ##                     0.0                     1.0                     0.0 
    ## patientC:conditiontreat patientD:conditiontreat 
    ##                     0.5                     0.5

We can set our contrasts in exactly the same way as we did in the
previous section (for completeness, we also give the contrasts using
DESeq’s named coefficients).

bloodA vs bloodO (in the control):

``` r
res1_bloodA_bloodO_control <- results(dds, contrast = bloodA_control - bloodO_control)
# or equivalently
res2_bloodA_bloodO_control <- results(dds, 
                                 contrast = list(c("patient_B_vs_A"), # Blood type A
                                                 c("patient_C_vs_A", # Blood type O
                                                   "patient_D_vs_A"))) # Blood type O
```

bloodA vs bloodO (in the treat):

``` r
res1_bloodO_bloodA_treat <- results(dds, contrast = bloodO_treat - bloodA_treat)
# or equivalently
res2_bloodO_bloodA_treat <- results(dds, 
                           contrast = list(c("patient_B_vs_A", # Blood type A
                                             "patientB.conditiontreat"), # Interaction of patient B with treatment
                                           c("patient_C_vs_A", # Blood type O
                                             "patient_D_vs_A", # Blood type O
                                             "patientC.conditiontreat", # Interaction of patient C with treatment
                                             "patientD.conditiontreat"))) # Interaction of patient B with treatment
```

And so on, for other contrasts of interest…

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Extra: imbalanced design

Let’s take our previous example, but drop one of the samples from the
data, so that we only have 2 replicates for it.

``` r
dds <- dds[, -1] # drop one of the patient C samples
dds <- DESeq(dds)
resultsNames(dds)
```

    ## [1] "Intercept"                  "patient_B_vs_A"            
    ## [3] "patient_C_vs_A"             "patient_D_vs_A"            
    ## [5] "condition_treat_vs_control" "patientB.conditiontreat"   
    ## [7] "patientC.conditiontreat"    "patientD.conditiontreat"

Define our model matrix and coefficient vectors:

``` r
mod_mat <- model.matrix(design(dds), colData(dds))
mod_mat
```

    ##          (Intercept) patientB patientC patientD conditiontreat
    ## sample2            1        0        1        0              0
    ## sample3            1        0        1        0              0
    ## sample4            1        0        1        0              1

Now let’s check what happens to the bloodO_control group:

``` r

    ##             (Intercept)                patientB                patientC 
    ##                     1.0                     0.0                     0.4

    ##                     0.6                     0.0                     0.0

    ##                     0.0                     0.0

Notice that whereas before “patientC” and “patientD” had each a weight
of 0.5, now they have different weights. That’s because for patientC
there’s only 2 replicates. So, we have a total of 5 bloodtype O
individuals in the control (2 from patient C and 3 from D). Therefore,
when we calculate the average coefficients for bloodOs, we need to do it
as 0.4 x patientC + 0.6 x patientD.

The nice thing about this approach is that we do not need to worry about
any of this, the weights come from our `colMeans()` call automatically.
And now, any contrasts that we make will take these weights into
account:

``` r
# bloodA vs bloodO (in the control)
bloodA_control - bloodO_control
```

    ##             (Intercept)                patientB                patientC 
    ##                     0.0                     0.5                    -0.4 
    ##                patientD          conditiontreat patientB:conditiontreat 
    ##                    -0.6                     0.0                     0.0 
    ## patientC:conditiontreat patientD:conditiontreat
